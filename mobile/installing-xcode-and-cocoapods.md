title: Installing Xcode and CocoaPods (iOS development only)
---

Xcode is the IDE for working with the iOS deployment of the app. Xcode allows us to run the app in an iPhone simulator running on a Mac.

CocaoPods is an iOS development package manager (similar to npm/yarn for Nodejs) that allows apps to use native packages. 

# Installing Xcode 
Go to the [Xcode App Store Listing](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) and click on "Get" to install Xcode. Enter your Apple ID credentials if prompted.

# Installing CocoaPods
Open the Terminal from Spotlight, and run `sudo gem install cocoapods`. You may be prompted to enter your password: enter your password. You will not see the dots/characters of the password when you type your password in the terminal, as a security precaution.
