# Overview
To prepare the mobile app and analysis engine for new seasons and competitions, we must associate the new season data in the DB. 
In this document, databases and collections will be referred to in the following syntax: `database/collection`.

## `complist/data`
1. Create new competition listing

Example entry:

```json
{
    "_id": {
        "$oid": "61da0e5b584997e2ddebd149"
    },
    "competition": "2022iacf",
    "friendlyName": "2022 Iowa Regional - Cedar Falls, IA"
}
```

The OID attribute will automatically be generated by MongoDB. The `competition` attribute should be the same identifier as is used in The Blue Alliance to facilitate interoperability between the two platforms. 

The friendlyName attribute will be displayed at the top of the app, thus it should contain useful information about the current competition. At a minimum it should contain the name of the competition and the location.

## `teamlist/competitions`
1. Create new team listing (if applicable)
While our team already has a team entry, if a new team is joining they will need to have a new team listing created. The object structure is as follows:

* team (string): Team number
  * example: "2022"
* currentCompetition (string): The competition identifier for the team's current competition, as created above. 
  * example: "2022iacf"
* authorizedDomains (array<string>): An array of domains from which users may sign in using their issued Google accounts.
  * example: ["imsa.edu"]
* authorizedUsers (array<string>): An array of users that do not belong to the above domain but should also be allowed to sign in. This feature is useful for mentors, etc.
  * example: ["mentor@frc2022.com", "student@frc2022.com"]
* admins (array<string>): An array of users that are technical administrators for the team. This array is not currently used but will be used in the future to only allow admins to perform certain privileged tasks. 
  * example: ["admin@frc2022.com", "root@frc2022.com"]

Example entry: 
```json
{
   "team":"2022",
   "currentCompetition":"2022iacf",
   "authorizedDomains":[
      "imsa.edu"
   ],
   "authorizedUsers":[
      "mentor@frc2022.com",
      "student@frc2022.com"
   ],
   "admins":[
      "admin@frc2022.com",
      "root@frc2022.com",
   ]
}
```
2. Set team's `currentCompetition` attribute to current competition identifier.
 
## `teamlist/nicknames`

Ensure that the nicknames for all teams at this competition is present in this object. You can find this data on The Blue Alliance or other FRC sources. 
Since this list is not changed per competition, some teams may already be present as we have competed with them before.
    
## `configs/match` and `config/pit`

These configs need to be created to configure the scouting application for each new competition. Refer to previous competitions' configs for guidance.

## `data_scouting/matches`
Documentation in progress - define each match with teams and associated scouters (initially set to false but populated by the API)
