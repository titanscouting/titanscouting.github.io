# tra_analysis.Analysis

The primary imported module. Contains the most basic data analysis tools along with import links for other `tra_analysis` submodules. The documentation for the submodule specific tools are contained here, the linked imports are documented in their own articles.

Note: After update 3.x, the module was renamed to `Analysis` from `analysis`, however the old import name can still be used but support will be removed in future updates.
