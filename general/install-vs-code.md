# Installing VS Code
VS Code is the IDE that we will generally be using for all Titan Scouting projects. You are free to use the IDE of your choice, however, support for this IDE is not guaranteed. 


## Windows and Mac
To install VS Code, navigate to [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com) and click the Download button in the center of the screen. 

If you are on Windows, run the downloaded installer and VS Code will be installed. 

If you are on Mac, drag the downloaded file to your Applications. VS Code is now installed.

## Linux
VS Code is available on the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io). For instructions, see [here](https://snapcraft.io/code). 

There are other ways to install VS Code on Linux if your distribution does not support Snap packages, and you are free to use them. However, these methods will not be supported by Titan Scouting.
